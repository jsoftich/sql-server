    sp_Blitz v11 - Sept 26, 2012
    
    (C) 2012, Brent Ozar PLF, LLC

To learn more, visit http://www.BrentOzar.com/go/blitz where you can download
new versions for free, watch training videos on how it works, get more info on
the findings, and more.

Known limitations of this version:
 - No support for offline databases. If you can't query some of your databases,
   this script will fail.  That's fairly high on our list of things to improve
   since we like mirroring too.
 - No support for SQL Server 2000.
 - If the server has databases in compatibility mode 80, sp_Blitz will fail.

Unknown limitations of this version:
 - None.  (If we knew them, they'd be known.  Duh.)

Changes in v11:
 - Added check for optimize for ad hoc workloads in sys.configurations.
 - Added @OutputType parameter. Choices:
 	- 'TABLE' - default of one result set table with all warnings.
	- 'COUNT' - Sesame Street's favorite character will tell you how many
				problems sp_Blitz found.  Useful if you want to use a
				monitoring tool to alert you when something changed.

Changes in v10:
 - Jeremiah Peschka added check 59 for file growths set to a percentage.
 - Ned Otter added check 62 for old compatibility levels.
 - Wayne Sheffield improved checks 38 & 39 by excluding more system tables.
 - Christopher Fradenburg improved check 30 (missing alerts) by making sure
   that alerts are set up for all of the severity levels involved, not just
   some of them.
 - James Siebengartner and others improved check 14 (page verification) by
   excluding TempDB, which can't be set to checksum in older versions.
 - Added check 60 for index fill factors <> 0, 100.
 - Added check 61 for unusual SQL Server editions (not Standard, Enterprise, or
   Developer)
 - Added limitations note to point out that compatibility mode 80 won't work.
 - Fixed a bug where changes in sp_configure weren't always reported.

Changes in v9:
 - Alex Pixley fixed a spelling typo.
 - Steinar Anderson http://www.sqlservice.se fixed a date bug in checkid 2.
   That bug was reported by several users, but Steinar coded the fix.
 - Stephen Schissler added a filter for checkid 2 (missing log backups) to look
   only for databases where source_database_id is null because these are
   database snapshots, and you can't run transaction log backups on snapshots.
 - Mark Fleming @markflemingnl added checkid 62 looking for disabled alerts.
 - Checkid 17 typo changed from "disabled" to "enabled" - the check
   functionality was right, but it was warning that auto update stats async
   was "disabled".  Disabled is actually the default, but the check was
   firing because it had been enabled.  (This one was reported by many.)

Changes in v8 May 10 2012:
 - Switched more-details URLs to be short.  This way they'll render better
   when viewed in our SQL Server Management Studio reports.
 - Removed ?VersionNumber querystring parameter to shorten links in SSMS.
 - Eliminated duplicate check for startup stored procedures.

Changes in v7 April 30 2012:
 - Thomas Rushton http://thelonedba.wordpress.com/ @ThomasRushton added check
   58 for database collations that don't match the server collation.
 - Rob Pellicaan caught a bug in check 13: it was only checking for plan guides
   in the master database rather than all user databases.
 - Michal Tinthofer http://www.woodler.eu improved check 2 to work across
   collations and fix a bug in the backup_finish_date check.  (Several people
   reported this, but Michal contributed the most improvements to this check.)
 - Chris Fradenburg improved checks 38 and 39 by excluding heaps if they are
   marked is_ms_shipped, thereby excluding more system stuff.
 - Jack Whittaker fixed a bug in checkid 1.  When checking for databases
   without a full backup, we were ignoring the model database, but some shops
   really do need to back up model because they put stuff in there to be
   copied into each new database, so let's alert on that too.  Larry Silverman
   also noticed this bug.
 - Michael Burgess caught a bug in the untrusted key/constraint checks that
   were not checking for is_disabled = 0.
 - Alex Friedman fixed a bug in check 44 which required a running trace.
 - New check for SQL Agent alerts configured without operator notifications.
 - Even if @CheckUserDatabaseObjects was set to 0, some user database object
   checks were being done.
 - Check 48 for untrusted foreign keys now just returns one line per database
   that has the issue rather than listing every foreign key individually. For
   the full list of untrusted keys, run the query in the finding's URL.

Changes in v6 Dec 26 2011:
 - Jonathan Allen @FatherJack suggested tweaking sp_BlitzUpdate's error message
    about Ad Hoc Queries not being enabled so that it also includes
    instructions on how to disable them again after temporarily enabling
    it to update sp_Blitz. 

Changes in v5 Dec 18 2011:
 - John Miner suggested tweaking checkid 48 and 56, the untrusted constraints
    and keys, to look for is_not_for_replication = 0 too.  This filters out
    constraints/keys that are only used for replication and don't need to
    be trusted.
 - Ned Otter caught a bug in the URL for check 7, startup stored procs.
 - Scott (Anon) recommended using SUSER_SNAME(0x01) instead of 'sa' when
    checking for job ownership, database ownership, etc.
 - Martin Schmidt http://www.geniiius.com/blog/ caught a bug in checkid 1 and
    contributed code to catch databases that had never been backed up.
 - Added parameter for @CheckProcedureCache.  When set to 0, we skip the checks
    that are typically the slowest on servers with lots of memory.  I'm
    defaulting this to 0 so more users can get results back faster.

Changes in v4 Nov 1 2011:
 - Andreas Schubert caught a typo in the explanations for checks 15-17.
 - K. Brian Kelley @kbriankelley added checkid 57 for SQL Agent jobs set to
      start automatically on startup.
 - Added parameter for @CheckUserDatabaseObjects.  When set to 0, we skip the
    checks that are typically the slowest on large servers, the user
    database schema checks for things like triggers, hypothetical
    indexes, untrusted constraints, etc.

Changes in v3 Oct 16 2011:
 - David Tolbert caught a bug in checkid 2.  If some backups had failed or
        been aborted, we raised a false alarm about no transaction log backups.
 - Fixed more bugs in checking for SQL Server 2005. (I need more 2005 VMs!)

Changes in v2 Oct 14 2011:
 - Ali Razeghi http://www.alirazeghi.com added checkid 55 looking for
   databases owned by <> SA.
 - Fixed bugs in checking for SQL Server 2005 (leading % signs)


Explanation of priority levels:
  1 - Critical risk of data loss.  Fix this ASAP.
 10 - Security risk.
 20 - Security risk due to unusual configuration, but requires more research.
 50 - Reliability risk.
 60 - Reliability risk due to unusual configuration, but requires more research.
100 - Performance risk.
110 - Performance risk due to unusual configuration, but requires more research.
200 - Informational.
